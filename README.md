# VideoTextures

### Overview
Video Textures are a proposed media for displaying videos. By identifying multiple similar pairs within a video, we can "jump back" while playing a video, in the same way as a looping animation. These jumps are made randomly, producing procedurally generated video. 

This form of media is proposed to be applicable to the world of advertising, or using a scene or video to make an impression.

### Presentation
